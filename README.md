# Budget Tracker

## Description

Do you want to get in better financial shape?

This budget tracker will allow you to log your finances into a handy app that you can take with you anywhere, even if you don't have internet access. All you need to do is visit the app and log your deposits or purchases with the click of a button, then you'll see the chart of how much money you currently have. If you use the application offline, when you once again have internet, you'll be able to see the changes online, too.

Get ready to excel at budgeting!

This budget tracker was written in JavaScript using Express.js, Mongoose, Node.js, IndexedDB, MongoDB Atlas, Service Worker API, HTML, and CSS. It's deployed on Heroku.
